# **24 Game Solver**

## **Description**

This is a learning project that provides a command-line script to solve the classic 24 Game. The program takes four numbers as input and attempts to find a combination of basic arithmetic operations (+, \-, \*, /) that results in the value 24\.

## **Features**

* Solves the 24 Game for any four given numbers.  
* Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
* Provides the full mathematical expression of the solution if one is found.  
* Handles invalid input gracefully, prompting the user to enter exactly four numbers.  
* Allows the user to exit the program by typing x.

## **Installation**

This project does not require any special installation. Simply download the 24GameSolver.py file.

## **Dependencies**

This script is written in standard Python and has no external dependencies. It should run on any system with a Python 3 interpreter.

## **Usage**

To run the solver, navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal and execute the following command:

python 24GameSolver.py

The program will then prompt you to enter four numbers separated by spaces. For example:

Provide four numbers separated by spaces or e(x)it: 1 2 3 4

The program will then output a solution if one is found, or indicate that no solution exists.
